This is a website built as a project for Holberton School. It is generally
modeled after Twitter's site and will eventually include similar functionality
as Twitter.

To get started developing, clone the repository and open in a server with
PHP installed. You will need to install Node.js and the package manager ``npm``.
Once installed, run ``npm install`` to load the dependencies. If you are editing
JavaScript or Sass you will need to run ``grunt`` before any saving is done.
This will start up a grunt server and compress all your changes into the
js/script.js and css/styles.css files.
